To keep the project clean and organized, please place all media-related folders inside a single directory named assets.

Required Structure
assets/
│── icons/
│── music/
│── videos/

Why this structure?

Easier to manage static files

Cleaner project hierarchy

Prevents scattered resource folders

Ensures consistent referencing paths in the code

Make sure all references in HTML/CSS/JS follow this format:

src="assets/icons/...”
src="assets/music/...”
src="assets/videos/...”
